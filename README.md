## Overview

FlowGuard is designed to:

- Collect and process real-time traffic data across Ludhianaâ€™s key hotspots
- Predict future congestion levels and bottleneck risks using a spatiotemporal LSTM model
- Optimize routes dynamically, accounting for upcoming merges and predicted traffic shifts
- Provide interactive visualizations and statistics via a Streamlit interface
- Offer speed recommendations to help users avoid heavy congestion

## System Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion & Processing**  
   - Fetches data from TomTom Traffic API at 2â€‘minute intervals  
   - Normalizes speed and computes metrics such as freeâ€‘flow ratio and confidence scores

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Builds temporal sliding windows of traffic features per road segment  
   - Derives speedâ€‘trend and spatial context matrices for model input

3. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - Spatiotemporal LSTM with multiâ€‘head attention for sequence and spatial data  
   - Dualâ€‘task outputs: speed prediction (MSE loss) and bottleneck risk (binary crossâ€‘entropy loss)  
   - Converted to TensorFlow Lite for lowâ€‘latency edge inference

4. **Route Optimization**  
   - A* pathfinding over an OSMnx/NetworkX graph  
   - Travelâ€‘time heuristics informed by ML predictions  
   - Dynamic rerouting to avoid predicted mergeâ€‘point delays

5. **Visualization Dashboard**  
   - Streamlit app with Folium maps and plotly charts  
   - Displays current congestion levels, forecasts, and optimized routes  
   - Filters by time of day and highlights predicted bottlenecks
